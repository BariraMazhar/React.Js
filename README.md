# React Counter App 🔢

This is a simple **React.js practice project** — a counter application with some added logic and styling.  
The project demonstrates **React state management, conditional rendering, and event handling**, along with styling using **Tailwind CSS**.

---

## 📌 Features

- The counter **starts from 0**.
- The counter can be increased or decreased using two buttons:
  - **Increase** ➝ adds `+1` to the current value.
  - **Decrease** ➝ subtracts `-1` from the current value.
- **Minimum limit: 0**  
  - The counter will **not decrease below 0**.  
  - Even if you keep clicking the **Decrease** button, it will stay at 0.
- **Maximum limit: 100**  
  - The counter will **not increase beyond 100**.  
  - Clicking **Increase** at 100 will have no effect.
- Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and responsive UI.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project is part of my React learning journey.  
Through this app, I practiced:
- Handling **state** in React (`useState` hook).
- Implementing **conditional logic** for restricting values.
- Structuring React components.
- Applying **Tailwind CSS** for fast and consistent styling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js** (JavaScript library for UI)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first CSS framework)
- **Node.js & npm** (development environment & package management)

## Note:
This is a practice project created while learning React.
The logic can be extended to build more advanced counters or similar interactive components.
